This is a project I worked on for my first year, it is a simple password manager that uses firebase as the backend and is designed to make managing your online presence as easy as possible whilst maintaining security. If i were to implement this code further I would add wider display size support as well as obfuscate the code, and implement the encryption key server side. It also contains a password generator that can be used to generate a three word 4 digit number password with some characters at the end designed to be easy to remember and customizable.
