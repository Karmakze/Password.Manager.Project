This is a project I worked on for my first year, it is a simple password manager that uses firebase as the backend and is designed to make managing your ownline presence as easy as possible whilst maintaining security. If i were to implement this code further I would add wider display size support as well as obfuscate the code, and implement the encryption key server side
